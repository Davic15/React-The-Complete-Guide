## Section 01 - Getting Started

## What is React.js?.

    - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    - It is reactive.
    - JavaScript is used in React in the client side.
    - Vanilla JavaScript can be used.

## ReactJS vs "Vanilla JavaScript": Why use React?

    - In React we can mix up, HTML and JavaScript in the same file.
    - React = Declarative UI Programming.
    - With React, you define the target UI state(s), (define the goal, not the steps).
    - With JavaScript, the code is written in an imperative way (define the steps, not the goal).
    - React uses JavaScript under the hood to update the UI.

## Editing our first React App

    - Basic app in CodeSandbox.

    - Fast-track path, summary about the course.

## Getting the most out of this course

    - Watch the videos and repeat them
    - Get alone and practice with code snapshots.
    - Help each other in the chat with other students, in Udemy and Discord.

## Creating React Projects: Browser-based vs Local Development

    - Local Setup, create the project in our pc.
    - Browser-based Setup, create remote React projects via CodeSandbox.

## Creating React Projects Locally

    - Install Node.js (LTS).
    - Install Visual Studio Code.
    - Format document in Visual Studio Code.
    - Install the zip file with the project.
    - We can use Vite or npx.

## Using CodeSandbox for React Development (No local setup required)

    - Type in your browser, react.new
    - It will allow you to write React Code in CodeSandbox.
