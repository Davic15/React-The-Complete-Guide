## Section 01 - Getting Started

## What is React.js?.
    - JavaScript library to build user interfaces.
    - Similar to Mobile apps, it feels very reactive.
    - Traditional method -> Request and Get the HTML Page, it is performed with JavaScript.
    - With React, Javascript runs in the browser, on the loaded page.
    - You can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) of the page.
    - React.js:
        - A client-side JavaScript library.
        - All about modern and reactive user interfaces.
        - Declarative, component-focused approach.

## Why React instead of "Just JavaScript"?
    - WIth JavaScript we need to write more code.
    - With React we can write small components, and use them as we want, and re-use them too.

## Building Single-Page-Applications (SPA) with React.
    - React can be used to control parts of HTML pages or entire pages. (Widget).
    - React can also be used to control the entire fronted of a web application. (SPA).
        - SPA, server only sends one HTML page.

## Exploring React.js alternatives (Angular/Vue).
    - React
        - Lean and focused component-based UI library.
            - Third parties can be added too, example, routing.
    - Angular
        - Complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
    - Vue.js
        - Complete component-based UI framework, includes most core features. Ab bit less popular than React & Angular.
