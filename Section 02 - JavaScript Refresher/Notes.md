### Section 02 - JavaScript Refresher

## Understanding "let" and "const".
    - let for values that change many times.
    - const for values that never change.

## Arrow Functions
    - Short than normal functions.
    - No more issues with th "this" keyword.
    - If the function gets only one argument we can omit ().
    - If we have only one line of code inside our arrow function we can omit {} and the return.

## Exports and Imports
    - A type of export is: export default person;
    - An other type of export is: export const number = 10;

    - An import could be: import person from './person.js'.
    - An other type of import is: import { number } from './utility.js'.
