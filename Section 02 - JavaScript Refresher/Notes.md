## Adding JavaScript to a page and how React projects differ

    - JavaScript can be ran in the browser (client side), in any computer (server side) and in mobile (via embedded websites).
    - JavaScript can be aded between the <script> tag or importing a file inside the <script> tag.
    - The defer attribute makes sure that the script loads when the website is already loaded.
        - Or you can write the <script> tag at the bottom of the <body> before close it.
    - The attribute type="module" allows us to use import in our JavaScript file.
