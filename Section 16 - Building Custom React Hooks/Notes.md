### Section 16 - Building Custom React Hooks

## Module Introduction.

    - Only call React hooks in React Functions.
        - React Components Functions.
        - Custom Hooks.
    - Only call React Hooks at the Top Level.
        - Don't call them in nested functions.
        - Don't call them in any block statements.

## What are Custom Hooks?

    - They are just regular functions.
        - Outsource stateful logic into re-usable functions.
        - Unlike 'regular functions', custom hooks can use other React hooks and React State.
        - Re-use logic.
